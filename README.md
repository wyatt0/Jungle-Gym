# Jungle-Gym

Jungle-Gym is a generative art project I created to explore the intersection of abstract geometry & programmatic vegetation. 
It creates an aesthetic that combines the purest forms of 3D graphics (poly cubes), with the purest forms of reality (vegetation).

I leveraged p5 & WebGL 
and gained experience with generative textures, curves, and using multiple graphic buffers.
